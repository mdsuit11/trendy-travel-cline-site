Why do people travel?

The answer is simple: we love it!

We enjoy the slow and peaceful breakfasts, the long walks, the new experiences, places, people and memories. They make us feel happy we are alive. No wonder! Travelling seems to combine most of the habits of healthy people.

What are the advantages of travelling? Why is travelling important?

Scientists have proven that travelling is good for both your body and your mind! Perhaps this is why we love it. Because we feel that a few minutes in the sun raise our vitamin D levels and improve our mood. Vitamin D has its health benefits too - it is good for our hearts.

The importance of travel ranges from lower chances of heart disease to relieving stress and anxiety. On top of the health benefits, travel can also enhance your creativity, your sense of happiness and satisfaction.

If you still need additional excuses/ reasons for why you should travel, read on to find out more about the main benefits of travelling the world!
##  Achieve peace of mind.

Most of us live in the city. Our daily routine involves navigating through urban landscapes on crowded public transport in chase of our busy schedules. Gradually stress accumulates. Problems loom large, burnout makes us feel dissatisfied with out job, we never seem to find time for adventure.

Travel is your cure!

Travelling can disconnect you from your daily routine. Once you break the repetitive pattern, pack your bags and hit the road, your mind can reset. Seeing new places, meeting new people, overcoming various challenges may even help you appreciate what you have left behind. It can help you take a step back and think about things and people you miss. You can get a better perspective on your life and remember all the good things.

Travelling lets you live life for its own sake!ects experienced on a daily basis.

### Improve your communication skills.
Are you a fan of international travel? Do you prefer remote and exotic locations?

Then you have probably been to places where your native language is not spoken. Sometimes you need to be quite ingenious when trying to relate with the locals. At one point you realise that every attempt to find a place or buy something involves a lot of pointing and gesturing. But gradually you pick up words.  Izquierda, mañana, dim sum, bossa nova, sushi, pastrami, gelato. Most of these you can smell, hear, taste and feel!

Meanwhile, you are also learning a lot about a new way of life, a new culture. You may even find new friends and expand your real-life social network. Especially if you are a fan of couchsurfing.

Another advantage of Ttravelling is that it also makes you interesting. Once you get back home, everyone will want to hear about your adventures and the new friends you found, or hear the new words you’ve learnt.

###  Broaden your horizons.

How do we meet the world? Books, the Internet, TV news and documentaries tell us about distant countries, people and their way of life. However, a TV report presents to you someone else’s point of view and may very well narrow your perspective instead of broadening your mind.

Travelling the world and meeting people living in different conditions and treating life differently is what really teaches you about the world. Once you actually go and visit, you may even challenge your own opinion about less known places and cultures.

Discovering new cultures can also help you see the issues and the challenges of your daily life in a new way.


### Boost your confidence.

Travelling to new lands has its benefits but it also comes with its challenges.

I’ve heard my share of scary stories. A huge bull blocking the narrow mountain path you have taken. A rickshaw man takes a side street and suddenly you find yourself in a gloomy slum. You ask the locals for directions and they take you to the neighbourhood chief who looks like the gangsters in movies. And what is really scary is that you are alone in an unknown place. You cannot rely on friends and relatives, or even on your language skills.

### Get real-life education.

You may learn a lot about the world from books. Textbooks are filled with facts and illustrations. Fiction takes us to new lands and introduces us to new people and ideas. But textbook facts cannot be smelled, heard, felt, or tasted.

Whereas travelling offers you the opportunity to meet the people, hear the music, taste the food, touch the yellow stones of the pyramids.

Explore new cultures

Discovering new music genres, spices and recipes through travelling enriches your life and increases life satisfaction. You can even recreate your exotic experiences for your friends once you return home and share with them what you have learned about the world. Invite them over and play the CD, prepare an extraordinary dish with the spices you bought, fill your home with the aroma of incense.

Learn about the world

I remember being impressed as I child by kids who could name the capitals of numerous countries. I couldn’t even remember three. The birthplace of this author? Hmmm... But I will never forget Paris with the flooded banks of the Seine, the gargoyles of Notre-Dame de Paris, the Jester statue at Stratford-upon-Avon. Or the bleak sculpture of the two metal swords and their shadows at the Canterbury Cathedral (so this is where the pilgrims from Canterbury Tales were going!).
