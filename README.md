Natural medicines come with several notable health benefits. For starters, natural cures often aim to identify and eradicate illness rather than suppress the symptoms. This approach is more likely to result in improved health than the use of pharmaceuticals.

As a result, a person who chooses natural remedies versus prescription medications may be better able to fight infections than those who rely on Big Pharma.

Finally, natural medicine promotes gut health. It does this by enhancing digestion and nurturing an environment in which beneficial microbes can thrive.
